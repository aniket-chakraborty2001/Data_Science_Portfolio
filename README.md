### [Project-8: Simple and Multiple Linear Regression](https://github.com/aniket-chakraborty2001/S-M_Linear_Regress.)
* R programming is used
* Timeline: May, 2023
* In R, lm() function is used to build the model
* The adjusted R-2 Score is important to know model accuracy
* P value determines a feature is important or not
* If P value is larger than significance level (0.05), we reject that feature from our linear relationship assumption
